The repository  has three directories each containing the source code for binary search tree, BTree, and AVL. Under each folder the code lives under the *directoryname.cpp* 

The code can be run from a standard terminal, a text editor, or a compiler. The trees can take in user input and can be easily 
manipulated.

The program was tested against certain inputs.
